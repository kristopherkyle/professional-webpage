# Introduction to Corpus Linguistics with Python
This tutorial was designed for individuals interested in an introduction to corpus linguistic analyses using Python. Although a few tutorials use English specific language models (part of speech taggers and parsers), the tutorial series was designed to be broadly language agnostic. No previous programming knowledge/experience is presumed. I have used versions of this tutorial in various iterations of an introductory corpus linguistics course.

# Introduction to Natural Language Processing with Python
This tutorial represents an introduction to natural language processing with Python through the iterative creation of a part of speech tagging model. It presumes some knowledge of Python (e.g., the tutorial introduced above), but is designed for advanced beginners. This tutorial was originally used as material in the Corpus Linguistics Working Group at the University of Oregon.

# Introduction to Statistics with R for Applied Linguists
This tutorial was designed to introduce language teaching students/professionals to statistical analyses often found/used in applied linguistics research. It is not meant to replace a full statistics course, but rather represents a quick introduction to the topic. I have used versions of this in various iterations of an introductory research methods in applied linguistics course.
