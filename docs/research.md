# Current projects
- We are currently finishing up Phase 2 of the ASC annotation project (gold-standard annotation of L1 written data and L2 spoken and written data), which will be used to train the second version of the ASC annotation tool
- We are also using our ASC annotation tool to investigate the relationship between characteristics of ASC use (e.g., the strength of association between a verb and the ASC it is used with) and second language writing and speaking proficiency
- We are in the process of refining the Lexicogrammatical Tagger (LxGrTgr) and evaluating its accuracy across a range of registers
- We are amost finished writing up our second report on POS tagging and dependency parsing L1 and L2 texts that represent both spoken and written registers
