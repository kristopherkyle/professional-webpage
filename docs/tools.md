- among many others

# Web Applications
I am currently developing a number of web applications for text analysis. Check back soon!

# Python Packages
I have developed some text analysis Python Packages (with more on the way):
- <a href = "https://github.com/kristopherkyle/lexical_diversity" target=”_blank”>lexical-diversity</a> is a toolkit for calculating a wide number of lexical diversity indices, and is the backbone of <a href = "https://www.linguisticanalysistools.org/taaled.html" target=”_blank”>TAALED</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/kristopherkyle/corpus_toolkit" target=”_blank”>corpus-toolkit</a> is a simple but scalable corpus analysis toolkit primarily designed for introductory corpus linguistics classes.
