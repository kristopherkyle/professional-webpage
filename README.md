# Bio
**Welcome!**

I am an assistant professor in the Linguistics Department at the University of Oregon.

My research focuses on how readers and listeners construct an impression of proficiency based on the lexical, lexicogrammatical, and syntactic features of a particular written or spoken text. I do this work from a usage-based/emergentist framework, and generally rely on language corpora to inform models of language use.

An important aspect of my research is developing text analysis tools to examine lexicogrammatical features in both reference corpora and in learner corpora. These tools include desktop applications, Python packages, and web applications.

When I am not conducting research or teaching, I enjoy engaging in outdoor shenanigans (often rock climbing) with my family.
